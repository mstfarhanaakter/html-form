    <i style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever wondered how to display a 
        webpage within another webpage? HTML iframes
         make this possible, offering a way to embed 
         external content, videos, maps, or other documents 
         directly into your site, creating a window to the 
         world within your own digital space. 
        Let's understand more!</i>

        <br><br>
        <img src="2.jpg" alt="iframe work" width="100%">
        <br><br>
        An <b style="color: blue;">HTML </b>iframe is an <b style="color: blue;">HTML </b> 
        tag that allows you to 
        embed another HTML document within a current <b style="color: blue;">HTML </b> document.

The &lt;iframe&gt; element can be used to insert content such as web pages, 
videos, maps, etc., within an existing web page, creating a window or 
frame in the web page where the embedded content can be displayed. <br><br>

<b>Importance of Using HTML iframes</b>
<ul style="list-style: square; text-align: justify;">
    <li>    Allows for content integration from various sources. 
            This means you can easily embed multimedia elements such as videos, maps,
            or interactive content from other platforms into your webpage.
    </li>
    <li>    Updating content within an iframe can be more 
            straightforward compared to updating content on a regular webpage.
    </li>
    <li>    Iframes support modular web design by allowing developers
             to create reusable web components. This feature can be a 
             significant time-saver, as developers can create a component 
             once and reuse it across different webpages or even different websites, 
            maintaining consistency and reducing the time and effort needed for coding.
