    <p style="text-align: justify;">HTML barely needs any introduction, given its massive application worldwide. 
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, the most widely used language for developing web applications. 
        HTML provides several tags that are can be used in almost any use case of a web application. 

        One such tag is the &lt;iframe&gt; s used for embedding a document within a document. 
            For example, embedding maps on a webpage or a youtube video on a web site.
        This article aims to focus on the HTML Iframes tag and its implementation. 
        It is an important HTML tag since many web applications need embedded elements like maps, web advertisements, etc.
        
        HTML is critical for web development, and if you've ever thought about choosing web development as a career path, 
        you'd nquestionably have come across this language. And that's probably why you are here in the first place.
